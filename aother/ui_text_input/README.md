## Bevy UI Text Input

Text input crate for Bevy UI using cosmic text.

![Text Input Example](input_screen.png)

#### Basic usage

Spawn a `TextInputNode` component to create a text input:

```
commands
        .spawn((
            TextInputNode::default(),
            Node {
                width: Val::Px(500.),
                height: Val::Px(250.),
                ..default()
            },
        ))
```

The size has to be set using `Node`, there isn't any support for responsive sizing yet.
The active text input is set using the `InputFocus` resource. Inputs can also be set to activate on clicks.

There are a couple of examples, `text_input` is the most complete:
```
cargo run --example text_input
```

#### Features

#### Problems + Bugs
* Scrolling can be glitchy if the line height isn't an exact divisor of the input box.
* The plugin can't access any existing `FontAtlasSet`s from `bevy_text` and has to create its own atlases for any fonts it uses.

#### Not supported (at least yet)
* IME
* Responsive sizing
* Rich text
* Syntax highlighting
* World UI
* Text2d
* Onscreen keyboard
* Clipboard on android
